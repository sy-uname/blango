Youâ€™ll need to create the media directory too, directly inside the blango project directory (the outer directory, not the inner blango directory that contains urls.py and settings.py, etc). You can check that media serving is set up correctly by also creating a file such as a test.txt file inside the media directory and checking if you can download it (the path will be, for example, /media/test.txt). The text file is not needed. Feel free to delete it if you want. Keeping it will not affect the project.
